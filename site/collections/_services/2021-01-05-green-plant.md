Using QGIS it was generated an atlas for Guatemala at 1:50.000 scale, showing relief, water, urban landcover, road network and important settlements. Data used for these maps was taken from official sources.&nbsp;

More than 200 maps were generated using atlas tools from QGIS, allowing to have each individual sheet based on coverage of a previously created index grid.
