In this project, the planning process, information gathering, its subsequent systematization and processing was carried out to generate vector layer files, containing the collected attributes.

A file with the geometry of the polygons of the sectors to be worked on, provided by the Department of Cadastre of the municipality, was used as a base. Additionally, very high resolution satellite imagery corresponding provided and available through open services were used to analyze physical characteristics at lot level.

Based on the available inputs and information collected during field works, the attribute table was built containing the specific information of each of the properties in the sectors under study, using the QGIS software.

Finally, we proceeded to creation of thematic cartography based on the information generated. For data collection, the Mapillary platform was used, generating a set of street level imagery.
